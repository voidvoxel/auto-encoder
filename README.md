### TODO

* Deep variants of neural networks
* Extract features from natural text


## Install

### Latest Version

The easiest way to get started is to install the latest stable release.

#### Stable Release

This will install the latest stable release of this library.
This channel releases software that expected to be stable enough for production
use.

```sh
npm i voidvoxel/auto-encoder
```

#### Release Candidate

This will install the latest release candidate (RC) of the library.
A(n) RC is a
[beta prerelease](https://github.com/voidvoxel/audo-encoder#beta-prerelease)
that is likely ready for production and will be released if no major bugs
present themselves during the RC testing phase.

```sh
npm i voidvoxel/auto-encoder#rc
```

#### Beta Prerelease

This will install the latest beta prerelease of the library.
There are likely still bugs that may make this unsuitable for production use.
The goal of the beta testing phase is to reduce the total number of bugs,
discover and patch any potential security vulnerabilities,
tidy up any ambiguous or unclean code,
and to polish existing features while trying not to add any new features.

```sh
npm i voidvoxel/auto-encoder#beta
```

#### Alpha Prerelease

This will install the latest alpha prerelease of the library.
These prereleases are at a far higher risk of containing bugs.
The goals of the alpha testing phase are to
add new experimental features that may potentially break existing code
without putting the more stable channels at risk,
so naturally, the alpha channel is the least stable release channel.
Use at your own risk, to your own reward.

```sh
npm i voidvoxel/auto-encoder#alpha
```
